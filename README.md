# Arduino-Learning

This is a repo with files for the arduino uno microcontroller. I was just messing around with some of the sensors i had lying around and learnt basic electrical engineering as well as basic C/C++

If you want to try these out for yourself you will need an Arduino Uno as well as the various sensors that I have used (can usually be found in a general arduino uno starter kit)
