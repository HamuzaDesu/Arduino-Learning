# Arduino-Learning

This is a repo with files for the arduino uno microcontroller. I was just messing around with some of the sensors i had lying around and learnt  basic electrical engineering as well as arduinos version of the C language (it's a bit different)

If you want to try these out for yourself you will need an Arduino Uno as well as the various sensors that oi have used (can usually be found in a general arduino uno starter kit)
